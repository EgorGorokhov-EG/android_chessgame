# My Implementation of chess on Android
This is a pet project I'm making. The only purpose of it is to learn android developement.
Made using only Android studio (i.e. it's not an unity project), written in Kotlin.
WIP.
# Description
Current game is playable though.

Implemented mechanics:
* you can move pieces 
* you can capture opponent's pieces
* you can do a check(chekmate)
* swaps on each turn

Will be added: 
* graphic representations of pieces itself
* ability to restart the game
* make game state cacheble

Hopefully will be implemented:
* some fancy graphics
* multiplayer
